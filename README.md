# Visuals-for-SanFrancisco
This dataset I'm going to analyze is from kaggle( https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime ) including the train and test dataset. This dataset is pretty interesting and worth to analyze, becasue it contains Datetime which is when the incidents occur, incident types, police department location, longitutude and latitude. I am unable to do that after visualization because of memory error. So if anyone wants to keep on that and give me a solution how to deal with that, I would be appreciated.
